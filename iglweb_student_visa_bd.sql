Applications for Algerian tourist visas require a number of items of documentation, in order for them to be approved. The first is a certificate of accommodation (also known as a certificat d&#39;hebergement legalis?) from the Algerian authorities.<br />\r\nAdditionally, you will need to show evidence of your hotel/accommodation booking confirmation. Finally, in order for your Algerian visa to be approved, you will be required to have an invitation from a registered travel agency in Algeria.<br />\r\nPlease note: Depending on where in Algeria you are traveling to, you may also be required to provide a travel itinerary. This is usually required for travelers to the south of Algeria.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlgerian Transit Visa<br />\r\nAlgeria also offers a transit visa. Essentially this permits applicants to transfer through Algeria for while they are en route to another destination. Again, this visa class is strictly for travel purposes only, and holders cannot engage in any work or extend their stay while on this visa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Algerian Business Visa<br />\r\nThe application process for the Algerian business visa is very similar in process to the Algerian tourist visa. However, applicants will also be required to show a letter of sponsorship from an acknowledged business as proof of their need to visit Algeria for business purposes.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Algerian business visa grants holders the right to attend meetings, conferences and other business-related activities. However, the holder is not permitted to be employed in any capacity during their time in Algeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Time required to issue visa:</strong><br />\r\nThe processing time for an Algerian visa often takes under a week, but this is not a universal rule. An Algerian visa&#39;s processing time depends very much on the type of visa, the nationality of the person applying, the time of year and other variables. Therefore, it is advised that applicants start the application process well in advance of their scheduled trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is compulsory for all international students to have Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for themselves and their dependents, where applicable, for the duration of the visa. The premium for OSHC is only to be paid once the PVA requirements have been met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<strong>How long is the Visa valid for?</strong><br />\r\nTourist: approximately 30 days. Multiple-entry: up to 90 days. Transit: maximum 48 hours. Business: dependent on each case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Other information:</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>What is the cost of a Visa?</strong><br />\r\nAlgerian visa applications may be submitted for either a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. The type of permit issued, the purpose of the visit and the nationality of the applicant may all impact upon the fee charged for processing the application. At present a single entry business permit when granted to a holder of a valid United Kingdom passport will cost GBP 28. The same category of permit when issued as a multiple entry grant will cost GBP 35. For Australian and New Zealand citizens the costs of Algerian Visas vary from $80 to $110 US dollars.&nbsp;<br />\r\nSecurity<br />\r\nThere is a high threat from terrorism in Algeria. Exercise extreme caution at all times as terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, targeting places frequented by expatriates and foreign travelers, such as restaurants, hotels and shopping centers.&nbsp;<br />\r\nIf visiting Algiers, exercise caution at all times. It is generally safe to move around the center of the city during the day. You should avoid areas that you do not know, particularly in the suburbs of the city, and especially after dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Embassy contact information:&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nPlease contact the nearest Algeria embassy for information on what documentation you may require to enter Algeria.

Visas for studies in Brazil are issued for up to one year (renewable).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will have to apply for your student visa well before your departure to Brazil at a Brazilian embassy or consulate in your home country. In most cases the application process takes two to three months, so allow plenty of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a temporary residence visa, students have to submit the following documents:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A passport that is valid for at least six months.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application form (Pedido de Visto) in duplicate.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two passport-size photos.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police statement of no criminal record (not older than 3 months), 1 original and 1 copy.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof of sufficient funds for the duration of the stay (this may be bank statements, scholarship letter or a letter of guarantee from your parents).</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical examination and yellow fever vaccination card (only if you are from countries it applies to).</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirmation from your educational institution in Brazil stating your enrolment and the duration of your stay. Your host university must be recognised by the Brazilian Ministry of Education.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once in Brazil you have to register with the federal police within 30 days of your arrival. Beware, federal police offices are sometimes found in international airports rather than the city you are living in (therefore, if you can bear it, complete your police registration when you land in the city you&rsquo;ll be studying in). Police registration is necessary to formalise your stay and to get an ID card for foreigners. If you fail to present yourself for police registration, a tax will be charged for each day past the 30 days limit. It may prevent you from applying for visa extensions or visa renewal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a temporary residence visa holder, you may also apply for a visa for accompanying family members. Note also that as a student in Brazil you are not permitted to take up any paid work, and it&rsquo;s the same for any dependents or spouse that come with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you need to renew your visa, you will have to submit an application to the Federal Police Department at least 30 days before the expiration date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Next steps:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re tempted to study a Masters in the home of the samba, you can take a look at the Brazilian Masters listed on our website.

The U.S. Embassy or Consulate will not make your information available to anyone and will respect the confidentiality of your information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should bring the following documents to your interview:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Documents demonstrating strong financial, social, and family ties to your home country that will compel you to return to your country after your program of study in the United States ends.</li>\r\n	<li>Financial and any other documents you believe will support your application and which give credible evidence that you have enough readily-available funds to meet all expenses for the first year of study and that you have access to funds sufficient to cover all expenses while you remain in the United States. M-1 applicants must demonstrate the ability to pay all tuition and living costs for the entire period of their intended stay.</li>\r\n	<li>Photocopies of bank statements will not be accepted unless you can also show original copies of bank statements or original bank books.</li>\r\n	<li>If you are financially sponsored by another person, bring proof of your relationship to the sponsor (such as your birth certificate), the sponsor&#39;s most recent original tax forms and the sponsor&#39;s bankbooks and/or fixed deposit certificates.</li>\r\n	<li>Academic documents that show scholastic preparation. Useful documents include school transcripts (original copies are preferred) with grades, public examination certificates (A-levels, etc.), standardized test scores (SAT, TOEFL, etc.), and diplomas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Dependents</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Spouses and/or unmarried children under the age of 21 who wish to accompany or join the principal visa holder in the United States for the duration of his or her stay require derivative F or M visas. There is no derivative visa for the parents of F or M holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Family members who do not intend to reside in the United States with the principal visa holder, but wish to visit for vacations only, may be eligible to apply for visitor (B-2) visas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spouses and dependents may not work in the United States on a derivative F or M visa. If your spouse/child seeks employment, the spouse must obtain the appropriate work visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting Documents for Dependents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants with dependents must also provide:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Proof of the student&#39;s relationship to his or her spouse and/or child (e.g., marriage and birth certificates)</li>\r\n	<li>It is preferred that families apply for their visas at the same time, but if the spouse and/or child must apply separately at a later time, they should bring a copy of the student visa holder&#39;s passport and visa, along with all other required documents.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Other Information</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5>Optional Practical Training (OPT)</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>F-1 visa holders may be eligible for up to 12 months of optional practical training following completion of all course requirements for graduation (not including thesis or equivalent), or after completion of all requirements. OPT is separate from a student&#39;s academic work, and time for OPT will not normally be reflected during the student&#39;s academic program or in the completed study date. Students applying for an F visa to do OPT may present an I-20 with an original end of study date that may have passed. However, these I-20s must be annotated by the designated school official to reflect approval of an OPT program that extends beyond the end of the regular period of study. In addition, the student must have proof that USCIS has approved their practical training program or that an application is pending, either in the form of an approved Employment Authorization Card or a Form I-797 indicating that s/he has a pending application for an OPT program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Validity of Student Visas After a Break in Studies</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Students who are away from classes for more than five months can expect to apply for and receive a new F-1 or M-1 student visa to return to school following travel abroad, as explained below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Students within the United States</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>A student (F-1 or M-1) may lose that status if they do not resume studies within five months of the date of transferring schools or programs, under immigration law. If a student loses status, unless USCIS reinstates the student&#39;s status, the student&#39;s F or M visa would also be invalid for future travel returning to the United States. For more information see the USCIS website, and instructions for Application for Extend/Change of Nonimmigrant Status Form I-539 to request reinstatement of status.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Students - Returning to the United States from Travel Abroad</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Students who leave the United States for a break in studies of five months or more may lose their F-1 or M-1 status unless their activities overseas are related to their course of study. In advance of travel, students may want to check with their designated school official, if there is a question about whether their activity is related to their course of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immigration inspector at port of entry is presented a previously used, unexpired F-1 or M-1 visa by a returning student who has been outside the United States and out of student status for more than five months, a CBP immigration inspector may find the student inadmissible for not possessing a valid nonimmigrant visa. CBP may also cancel the visa after granting the student permission to withdraw the application for admission. Therefore, it is prudent for students to apply for new visas at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad prior to traveling to the United States to return to their studies, after an absence of more than five months that is not related to their course of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">for more information :&nbsp;https://www.ustraveldocs.com/kh/kh-niv-typefandm.asp</span></p>\r\n', '2018-09-11', '2021-02-17', 1),

The Colombia student visa is relatively easy to get. And a student visa is a good way to stay longer in Colombia than the six-month tourist visa permits. We provide 2021 updates to the Colombia student visa rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be eligible for a student visa you need to be enrolled in a public or private educational establishment that is recognized by the Colombian government. Most universities in Colombia are approved. In addition, you need to be taking at least 10 hours of classes per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Colombia student visa used to be known as the TP-3 visa. The student visa is typically valid for the time you are enrolled in an approved school. I previously had two TP-3 student visas that were valid for one-year each when I was was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/eafit/\">taking Spanish classes at Universidad EAFIT</a>&nbsp;in Medell&iacute;n.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are now two types of Colombia student visas. The Migrant (M) student visa is intended for those studying a degree program, such as a bachelors degree. And the Visitor (V) student is intended for non-degree programs like studying Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Coronavirus Visa Impacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Has the visa process changed in Colombia due to coronavirus?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the Colombian visa process had changed due to coronavirus and the quarantine in Colombia. Migracion Colombia offices were closed for over five months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/migracion-colombia-offices-reopen/\">Migracion Colombia offices reopened</a>&nbsp;on September 21 with a resumption of services. So, it is now possible to obtain tourist visa extensions and cedulas for foreigners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 21, 2020, Migraci&oacute;n Colombia reopened it offices in Colombia and restarted operations for the following services:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Issuance of the Alien Identification Card C&eacute;dula de Extranjer&iacute;a and its duplicate,</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign Registration for both minors and adults,</li>\r\n	<li>Certificates of Migratory Movements,</li>\r\n	<li>Certificate of Migratory Movements and Nationality,</li>\r\n	<li>Safe conduct (Salvoconductos) SC-1 and SC-2,</li>\r\n	<li>Temporary Permits of Stay (PTP) for extensions of stay in the national territory and a category change,</li>\r\n	<li>PEP-FF &ndash; this is for Venezuelan citizens.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>According to ExpatGroup, the visa agency we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/medellin-guru-visa-services/\">partnered with</a>, they have been submitting visa applications online without issues and have been receiving visa approvals since the coronavirus pandemic started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visa agency we partnered with has helped many foreigners obtain visas during the pandemic including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/student-visa/\">student visas</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/retirement-visa/\">retirement visas</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/marriage-visa/\">marriage visas</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/investment-visa/\">investment visas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/resident-visa/\">resident visas</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The new Language School building at Universidad EAFIT in MedellÃ­n\" src=\"https://medellinguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_7436-1024x686.jpg\" style=\"height:686px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Language School building at Universidad EAFIT in Medell&iacute;n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Colombian Now Has Two Types of Student Visas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Colombia changed its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/colombian-visa/\">Colombian visa rules</a>&nbsp;in late 2017. And these new visa rules went into effect on December 15, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, a Colombia student visa changed and is known as a Migrant (M) visa of category 9 (an M-9 visa) or as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/visitor-visa/\">Visitor (V) visa</a>. Furthermore, if you have an existing TP-3 student visa, it doesn&rsquo;t change to one of the new types of student visas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The M student visa is intended for those studying a degree program, like for a bachelors degree. The V student visa is intended for non-degree programs like studying Spanish. The M student visa can be for longer than one year depending on the length of studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, with the new M-9 or V student visas you are not permitted to work in Colombia. This is the same as the previous TP-3 student visas. Also, a M-9 visa loses its validity if you leave Colombia for over six months without returning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost for the M-9 student visa is $67 USD. This is higher than the previous TP-3 student visa that cost $55.&nbsp; So, the visa price has increased somewhat for the new student visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the Visitor (V) student visa for studying Spanish are some some cases being granted for only for a maximum of six months according to visa agencies we have talked but some may still qualify for a year-visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, once you have a Visitor (V) visa you reportedly can no longer apply for another visa while in Colombia. To apply for another visa when you have a Visitor student visa you have to go to a foreign consulate in another country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Applying for a Colombia student visa\" src=\"https://medellinguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_9000-2-1024x683.jpg\" style=\"height:683px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applying for a Colombia student visa</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How to Apply for a Colombia Student Visa</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can apply for a Colombia student visa online. In addition, you can obtain Colombian visas at Colombian consulates around the world. In the U.S., Colombia has consulates located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, Newark, New York, San Francisco and Washington DC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Colombian visa process is fairly easy as it&rsquo;s done online. You can apply for a Colombia visa online&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tramitesmre.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites/enlinea/solicitarVisa.xhtml\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://tramitesmre.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites/enlinea/solicitarVisa.xhtml\'); return false;\">here</a>. This application will require scans of all required documents in PDF files plus the photo in jpg format. In addition, a detailed guide for applying online is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/FOTOS2019/visa_en_linea_web_1.pdf\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/FOTOS2019/visa_en_linea_web_1.pdf\'); return false;\">found here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After receiving the online visa approval, if doing this in Colombia, you need to travel to Bogot&aacute; to get the visa in your passport. Or if at another country you can get the visa put in your passport at a Colombian consulate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visas in Colombia are issued at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en\'); return false;\">Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores</a>&nbsp;office in Bogot&aacute;. This is located at Avenida 19 # 98-03, Torre 100 Building, 3rd Floor. It&rsquo;s open from 7:30 am until noon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I successfully obtained three Colombian visas that I applied for my own in the past (including two TP-3 student visas) that were good for a total of five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the biggest challenge with doing a Colombian visa yourself is not benefiting from the experiences of a a visa agency, which has processed hundreds of visas and knows exactly what is needed for each type of visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, another big benefit of using a visa agency is that they offer services to courier your passport to Bogot&aacute; to get the visa put in your passport. So, you can avoid a trip to Bogot&aacute;. The cost of a visa service including the service to courier your passport to Bogot&aacute; can even be cheaper than the cost of a trip to Bogto&aacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for my latest visa received in 2018, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/resident-visa/\">Colombia resident visa</a>, I used a visa agency. And I found the experience painless and now highly recommend using a visa service instead of doing a Colombia visa application yourself. The bottom line is with a visa agency you are less likely to run into problems and you can avoid a trip to Bogot&aacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spanish Schools in Medell&iacute;n That Offer Student Visas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are at least three universities normally offering Spanish language programs in Medell&iacute;n that qualify for a student visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/eafit/\">Universidad EAFIT</a>&nbsp;located in El Poblado,</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.upb.edu.co/en/admissions/language-center-inscriptions/spanish-program-for-foreign-students\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://www.upb.edu.co/en/admissions/language-center-inscriptions/spanish-program-for-foreign-students\'); return false;\">Universidad&nbsp;Pontificia&nbsp;Bolivariana (UPB)</a>&nbsp;located in Laureles and</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.udem.edu.co/index.php/en/program-of-spanish-for-foreigners\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://www.udem.edu.co/index.php/en/program-of-spanish-for-foreigners\'); return false;\">Universidad de Medell&iacute;n</a>&nbsp;in Bel&eacute;n.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Universidad EAFIT reportedly has the largest university Spanish program for foreigners in Medell&iacute;n and Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, there are at least two private schools that qualify for a student visa:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/olsa-international/\">OLSA International</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://elefun.com.co/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://elefun.com.co/\'); return false;\">Elefun</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://olsa-international.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://olsa-international.com/\'); return false;\">OLSA International</a>&nbsp;is offering both in-person classes and online classes during the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://medellinguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OLSA-international-partnership.jpg\" style=\"height:109px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Medellin Guru Partnered with OLSA International</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Medellin Guru reviewed all the Spanish schools in Medell&iacute;n and selected OLSA International as our recommended Spanish school partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features of the OLSA Spanish School Partnership</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ability to obtain a Colombian student visa</li>\r\n	<li>Lower prices for Spanish classes than at Universities</li>\r\n	<li>Only Spanish program in Colombia based on U.S. University Spanish curriculums</li>\r\n	<li>Curriculum emphasizes conversational Spanish, so you learn to speak faster</li>\r\n	<li>Location in Estadio is convenient to two metro stations</li>\r\n	<li>Owner of OLSA is from the U.S and has 25 years of education experience in the U.S.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/spanish-classes-at-olsa-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Take Spanish Classes at OLSA</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Documents Required for a Colombia Student Visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Documents required for student visa are similar to the previous TP-3 student visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Photocopy of the first page of your valid passport where your personal data is displayed.</li>\r\n	<li>Photocopy of the page of your passport with the last stamp of entry or departure of Colombia is located.</li>\r\n	<li>If you&rsquo;ve had a previous Colombian visa, a photocopy of this visa.</li>\r\n	<li>Certificate of admission or enrollment to studies of elementary school, high school or higher education in undergraduate school authorized in Colombia.</li>\r\n	<li>Photocopy of &ldquo;certificate of existence and legal representation&rdquo; from the university.</li>\r\n	<li>Authorization of the parents and designation of the person responsible for the student during his/her stay in Colombia, authenticated by a Colombian notary or consul in the case of minors.</li>\r\n	<li>International health insurance policy certificate showing you have an international health insurance policy.

We have a separate article that looks at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medellinguru.com/travel-insurance/\">travel insurance that meets this requirement</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>A letter (in Spanish) from the person with economic responsibility for the student guaranteeing the expenses of the student and documents showing economic solvency.

Instead, all you will need in order to legally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/europe/france/guide\">study in France</a>&nbsp;is a valid passport or other valid travel ID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a national from anywhere else in the world, you will need to obtain a student visa for France in order to be able to undertake study.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What type of French student visa will you need?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/sites/default/files/Schengen%20student%20visa.jpg\" style=\"height:199px; width:300px\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several types of French student visa, and the one you require will differ depending on how long you are planning to study in France for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Schengen student visa (short-stay)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If your studies will last less than three months, and you are sure you will not be spending any longer in the country, then you should apply for the&nbsp;<em>court s&eacute;jour pour &eacute;tude,</em>&nbsp;otherwise known as the short-stay or Schengen student visa. The Schengen student visa is issued free of charge and cannot be renewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Visa to sit entrance exams</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need to travel to France in order to sit one or more university entrance exams, you can apply for the&nbsp;<em>visa de court s&eacute;jour &eacute;tudiant concours</em>, which simply means a visa for sitting entrance exams. If you sit your exam and pass, you are then eligible to apply for a renewable, one-year residence permit. For more information, contact the admissions department of the French institution you wish to study at.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Temporary long-stay visa</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>visa de long s&eacute;jour temporaire pour &eacute;tudes&nbsp;</em>is a temporary student visa that allows you to study in France for a period of up to six months. With this student visa for France you do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;need to apply separately for a residence permit.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Long-stay visa</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Known as the&nbsp;<em>visa de long s&eacute;jour pour &eacute;tudes</em>&nbsp;or the extended-stay VLT-TS, the long-stay visa is what you need if you wish to study in France for longer than six months. This visa acts as a residence permit and lasts for the duration of your study period (normally three years for a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, two years for a master&rsquo;s program and four years for a PhD). Algerian nationals do not require the VLS-TS, but are subject to different provisions. Contact your institution or the French consulate/embassy in your own country for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to apply for a student visa for France</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/sites/default/files/Student%20visa%20application%20form_0.jpg\" style=\"height:202px; width:300px\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationals from a number of countries will apply for their French student visa through Campus France, the country&rsquo;s official national agency for higher education and international students. Those students would also have been required to use Campus France to apply to their chosen French institutions, via the CEF procedure. See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.campusfrance.org/en/page/a-country-using-cef-procedure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this list of countries</a>&nbsp;to find out if you need to apply for both your visa and your admission in this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your country of origin is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;listed in the link above, then you will be responsible for both your university application and your student visa application. Only once you have received acceptance onto a program at a French institution will you be eligible to apply for your student visa for France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to apply for your visa, you will need to contact the French consulate in your home country and provide them with the following, when requested:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>An official acceptance letter onto an accredited program at a French institution. This should be on officially headed paper, featuring your full details, the details of your program of study and the start and end dates of study.</li>\r\n	<li>Proof of sufficient funds for living in the country. The current amount required is &euro;615 (US$820) per month, which can be shown with a bank statement, a guarantor&rsquo;s letter or a notice of funding from a loan, scholarship or grant.</li>\r\n	<li>Proof of return ticket home. Often this is in the form of the actual ticket or reservation showing the date of departure, but can be a handwritten statement of intent, including intended departure dates.</li>\r\n	<li>Proof of medical insurance (minimum cover &euro;30,000, US$40,150)</li>\r\n	<li>Proof of accommodation. Can be shown in the form of student housing confirmation or a certificate of board and lodging or &lsquo;<em>attestation d&rsquo;accueil&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;(if you&rsquo;re living with friends or relatives).</li>\r\n	<li>Proof of proficiency in French, if you are studying a French-language course.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>On arrival in France</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/sites/default/files/french_flag.jpg\" style=\"width:300px\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you arrive in France with an extended stay VLS-TS, you will need to send the official form which was presented to you along with your visa to the French Office of Immigration and Integration (OFII). This can be by registered mail, or in person if you reside in Paris. In the same letter, you should also provide a copy of your valid passport, including pages showing your identity and the stamp issued upon entry into France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your form and copied passport pages have been received, you will be sent a receipt of confirmation with further instructions on your next steps if required. This may be an instruction to obtain a medical examination if you have not previously received one in your country of origin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often your institution of study will help you with this part of the process. In some cases, an agreement exists between the OFII and the school in question, meaning documents can be submitted to the school instead of the French authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all instances, you will be expected to pay a tax of &euro;58 (US$78) to handle administration costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Working in France with a French student visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/sites/default/files/Euro_1.jpg\" style=\"height:144px; width:152px\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a valid residence permit (the VLS-TS functions as such), as an international student you are eligible to take on paid work for 964 hours annually (this equates to about 60% full-time employment).

Before applying for a visa, all student visa applicants are required to be accepted and approved by their school or program. Once accepted, educational institutions will provide each applicant the necessary approval documentation to be submitted when applying for a student visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visa Descriptions and Qualifications</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>F-1 Visa</strong><br />\r\nThis is the most common type of student visa. If you wish wish to engage in academic studies in the United States at an approved school, such as an accredited U.S. college or university, private secondary school, or approved English language program then you will need an F-1 visa. You will also need an F-1 visa if your course of study is more than 18 hours a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>M-1 Visa</strong><br />\r\nIf you plan engage in non-academic or vocational study or training at a U.S. institution then you will need an M-1 visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information about each of these visas and opportunities for studying in the United States can be found at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.educationusa.info/pages/students/visa.php\">Education USA website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Information</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>U.S. Public School</strong><br />\r\nU.S. law does not permit foreign students to attend public elementary school (kindergarten to 8th grade) or a publicly funded adult education program.&nbsp; Hence, F-1 visas cannot be issued for study at such schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An F-1 visa can be issued for attendance at a public secondary school (grades 9 to 12), but the student is limited to a maximum of 12 months at the school. The school must also indicate on the I-20 that the student has paid the unsubsidized cost of the education and the amount submitted by the student for that purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about F-1 legal requirements, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa/foreign-students-in-public-schools.html\">Department of State website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Holders of A, E, F-2, G, H-4, J-2, L-2, M-2 or other derivative nonimmigrant visas may enroll in public elementary and secondary schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Student Assistance, Finding a U.S. School</strong><br />\r\nStudents who hope to enroll in an American educational institution are encouraged to contact Mohamadou Njie, Educational Adviser, at U.S. Embassy Banjul at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:Njiemm@state.gov\">Njiemm@state.gov</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dependents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spouses and/or unmarried children under the age of 21 who wish to accompany or join the principal visa holder in the United States for the duration of his/her stay require derivative F or M visas. There is no derivative visa for the parents of F or M holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Family members who do not intend to reside in the United States with the principal visa holder, but wish to visit for vacations only, may be eligible to apply for visitor (B-2) visas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spouses and dependents may not work in the United States on a derivative F or M visa. If your spuse/child seeks employment, the spouse must obtain the appropriate work visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Application Items</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for an F or M visa, you must submit the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application (DS-160) Form.

If a visa is issued, there may be an additional visa issuance reciprocity fee, depending on your nationality. The Department of State&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html\">website</a>&nbsp;can help you find out if you must pay a visa issuance reciprocity fee and what the fee amount is.</li>\r\n	<li>An approved Form I-20 from your U.S. school or program.</li>\r\n	<li>A Form I-901 SEVIS fee receipt indicating the SEVIS fee has been paid. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ice.gov/sevis/index.htm\">SEVIS website</a>&nbsp;has more details.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these items, you must present an interview appointment letter confirming that you booked an appointment through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ustraveldocs.com/gm/gm-niv-appointmentschedule.html\">this service</a>. You may also bring whatever supporting documents you believe support the information provided to the consular officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting Documents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting documents are only one of many factors a consular officer will consider in your interview. Consular officers look at each application individually and consider professional, social, cultural and other factors during adjudication. Consular officers may look at your specific intentions, family situation, and your long-range plans and prospects within your country of residence. Each case is examined individually and is accorded every consideration under the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caution:&nbsp;Do not&nbsp;present false documents. Fraud or misrepresentation can result in permanent visa ineligibility. If confidentiality is a concern, you should bring your documents to the Embassy in a sealed envelope. The Embassy will not make your information available to anyone and will respect the confidentiality of your information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should bring the following documents to your interview:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>All student visa applicants who have taken the WEAC exams must go to the WEAC Office in Banjul at least one week prior to their interview and request that WEAC send the official results of their exam to the Embassy.</li>\r\n	<li>Documents demonstrating strong financial, social, and family ties to your home country that will compel you to return to your country after your program of study in the U.S. ends.</li>\r\n	<li>Financial and any other documents you believe will support your application and which give credible evidence that you have enough readily-available funds to meet all expenses for the first year of study and that you have access to funds sufficient to cover all expenses while you remain in the United States. M-1 applicants must demonstrate the ability to pay all tuition and living costs for the entire period of their intended stay.</li>\r\n	<li>Photocopies of bank statements will not be accepted unless you can also show original copies of bank statements or original bank books.</li>\r\n	<li>If you are being financially sponsored by another person, please bring proof of your relationship to the sponsor (such as your birth certificate) and the sponsor&#39;s bank statements and/or fixed deposit certificates.</li>\r\n	<li>Academic documents that show scholastic preparation. Useful documents include school transcripts (original copies are preferred) with grades, public examination certificates (A-levels, etc.), standardized test scores (SAT, TOEFL, etc.), and diplomas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting Documents for Dependents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants with dependents must also provide:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Proof of the student&#39;s relationship to his/her spouse and/or child (e.g., marriage and birth certificates)</li>\r\n	<li>It is preferred that families apply for their visas at the same time, but if the spouse and/or child must apply separately at a later time, they should bring a copy of the student visa holder&#39;s passport and visa, along with all other required documents.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional Information</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Optional Practical Training (OPT)</strong><br />\r\nF-1 visa holders may be eligible for up to 12 months of optional practical training following completion of all course requirements for graduation (not including thesis or equivalent), or after completion of all requirements. OPT is separate from a student&#39;s academic work, and time for OPT will not normally be reflected during the student&#39;s academic program or in the completed study date. Students applying for a F visa to do OPT may present an I-20 with an original end of study date that may have passed. However, these I-20s must be annotated by the designated school official to reflect approval of an OPT program that extends beyond the end of the regular period of study. In addition, the student must have proof that USCIS has approved their practical training program or that an application is pending, either in the form of an approved Employment Authorization Card or a Form I-797 indicating that s/he has a pending application for an OPT program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Validity of Student Visas After a Break in Studies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students who are away from classes for more than five months can expect to apply for and receive a new F-1 or M-1 student visa to return to school following travel abroad, as explained below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Students within the U.S.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A student (F-1 or M-1) may lose that status if they do not resume studies within five months of the date of transferring schools or programs, under immigration law. If a student loses status, unless USCIS reinstates the student&#39;s status, the student&#39;s F or M visa would also be invalid for future travel returning to the U.S. For more information see the USCIS website, and instructions for Application for Extend/Change of Nonimmigrant Status Form&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=94d12c1a6855d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=db029c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD\">I-539</a>&nbsp;to request reinstatement of status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Students - Returning to the U.S. from Travel Abroad</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students who leave the U.S. for a break in studies of five months or more may lose their F-1 or M-1 status unless their activities overseas are related to their course of study. In advance of travel, students may want to check with their designated school official, if there is a question about whether their activity is related to their course of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immigration inspector at port of entry is presented a previously used, unexpired F-1 or M-1 visa by a returning student who has been outside the U.S. and out of student status for more than five months, a CBP immigration inspector may find the student inadmissible for not possessing a valid nonimmigrant visa. CBP may also cancel the visa after granting the student permission to withdraw the application for admission. Therefore, it is prudent for students to apply for new visas at an Embassy abroad prior to traveling to the U.S. to return to their studies, after an absence of more than five months that is not related to their course of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px\">for more information :&nbsp;https://www.ustraveldocs.com/gm/gm-niv-typefandm.html</span></p>\r\n', '2018-09-11', '2021-02-18', 1),

Take a look at the multiple study options you have as an international student</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you get on the plane, there are some important documents you&rsquo;ll need. If you are from a non-EU (non-European) country, you will most likely need a student visa for Ireland. Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re here to help with all that boring paperwork!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Student visa Ireland &ndash; What you need to know</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are thinking about moving to Ireland to study from Bangladesh, you may need a student visa. We recommend you check the document requirements for your country with the INIS (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service) and if you need a visa, ask your IDP counsellor to help with the visa application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When should I apply?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should apply for your Irish study visa as early as possible, as it normally takes eight weeks or longer to process. You can apply up to three months before you arrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do I need to submit as part of my visa application?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must submit the required documentation, passport photograph and appropriate fee for the correct visa type, to the correct offices. You may also be required to provide biometrics information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We highly recommend that you ask your IDP counsellor to guide you through the process, to ensure everything is done correctly. If the documentation is not what&rsquo;s required, you risk having your student visa refused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do I check on my visa status?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You can check your Ireland visa application status online, using your Visa Application Number. to see if your visa has been processed. This list is updated weekly</li>\r\n	<li>If your visa is approved, the Irish Embassy office will attach your visa to your passport</li>\r\n	<li>If your visa is refused, you can appeal the decision if it&rsquo;s within two months</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I get a visa for my spouse?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. Non-EU international students studying in Ireland are not allowed to bring their family with them. Spouses and children of international students can apply to live in Ireland separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens if my visa application is refused?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your visa application is refused, the college will refund the fees, minus a small application fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Student visa checklist</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A recent passport-sized photo</li>\r\n	<li>A passport that is valid for 12 months</li>\r\n	<li>A signed letter of application which explains why you require the visa</li>\r\n	<li>A Letter of Acceptance from the Irish university, college or school, confirming you have been accepted and enrolled on a course of full-time education</li>\r\n	<li>Evidence that you have paid your tuition fees in full or, if they are more than &euro;6,000, you must pay at least this amount to satisfy visa requirements</li>\r\n	<li>Evidence that you have taken out private health insurance that meets the requirements of your visa</li>\r\n	<li>Evidence of English language proficiency. Most Irish universities and colleges require IELTS of 6.5</li>\r\n	<li>Evidence that you or your sponsor has sufficient funds to cover your tuition fees and cost of living expenses</li>\r\n	<li>Evidence of your scholarship, if you have been granted one</li>\r\n	<li>If you are applying from China, India, Nigeria, Russia, United Arab Emirates or the United Kingdom, you may need further documentation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot involved in the visa application process. Take off the pressure and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.idp.com/global/enquiry-form/\" target=\"_blank\">get expert advice</a>&nbsp;from an IDP counsellor. We&rsquo;re here to help you with your visa application.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can I get an internship?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Irish study program include an internship or work placement. This part of the program cannot be more than 50% of the duration of the program. For example a four-year program allows a maximum of two years of work placement. Work placements must form an essential part of the study program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can I work when I finish my study?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Possibly. The Irish Government&rsquo;s Third Level Graduate Scheme offers graduates of Irish higher education institutions a one-year stay back visa so that they can stay in Ireland and seek employment. This is extended to two years for postgraduate students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legally resident non-EU third level graduates can also apply for a Green Card Permit, which is a way to stay in Ireland long term.

If you have a clear purpose and can demonstrate that you have the means and the ability to study in Japan, you will be able to acquire the coveted student visa in Japan in no time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>According to statistics by JASSO, in 2017, 829 Bangladeshi students were studying in Japanese language institutions. For aspiring Bangladeshi students, Japan is becoming an increasingly popular destination to study abroad. A student visa in Japan is required if you plan to enter a Japanese language school, a vocational school, or a college/ university for longer than 90 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What Do You Need To Do for a Study Visa in Japan?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to find a Japanese language school or a university to enroll in. The reason is that most schools offer visa sponsorship in order to get your Certificate of Eligibility issued by the Ministry of Justice in Japan, which will help your visa application process to run more smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you get accepted to a school or a university, the school will submit your application to the Immigration Bureau in Japan on your behalf. This process might take 2 to 3 months for the Immigration Bureau to approve your application, after which the school will send you a Certificate of Eligibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/schoolynkmedia/2020/05/267cbfc7-study-4857779_1920-1024x574.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Apply for a Certificate of Eligibility through Your School&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to receive a Certificate of Eligibility, you will have to prepare the following documents and submit them to your school or university. All of these documents need to be in either English or Japanese, or have notarized translations attached to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Application form</strong>:\r\n\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>You will fill in the information of your personal information and the course you are to be enrolled in.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Personal history form</strong>:\r\n\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>You will fill in your educational and/or professional history in the form.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Eight identical ID Photos (3 cm x 4 cm)</strong>:\r\n\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>Photos must show a clear and full front view of your face from the bottom of the chin to the top of the hair against a plain background.

Letter of sponsorship by your financial supporter</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>After You Have Received the Certificate of Eligibility&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After you have received the Certificate of Eligibility sent from your school or university,&nbsp; you will need to make an appointment at a Japanese Embassy in Bangladesh in order to apply for the official visa. The visa application fee is free for Bangladeshi nationals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are required to submit the following documents to the embassy in order to receive a student visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Application form</li>\r\n	<li>Passport and two photos (2 inch x 2 inch with white background)</li>\r\n	<li>Certificate of Eligibility (original copy)</li>\r\n	<li>Admission certificate from Japanese language school in Japan</li>\r\n	<li>Receipt for admission and/or tuition fees from a Japanese language school</li>\r\n	<li>Certificate of Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N1 &ndash; N5 (if applicable)</li>\r\n	<li>Language school certificate from language school in Bangladesh</li>\r\n	<li>Academic certificate, Registration card, Mark sheet of S.S.C. and H.S.C.</li>\r\n	<li>Valid airlines booking slip</li>\r\n	<li>Bank statement for six months from your financial supporter</li>\r\n	<li>Tax certificate &amp; paid amount receipt for 3 years from your financial supporter</li>\r\n	<li>Family tree with necessary passport copy /NID card/ Nikahnama to prove your relationship with financial supporter (if the supporter is not your parent)</li>\r\n	<li>Information on language School in Bangladesh: school photo, representative name, contact number, address</li>\r\n	<li>Japanese textbook (original copy)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to submitting your application documents, you will also be required to attend an interview at the same time with the embassy personnel. At the end of the interview, you will be instructed on the time and date and the method to collect your passport. This information is also written on the application receipt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further inquiries and appointments with the authorities, the following is the information of the Japanese Embassy in Bangladesh:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Embassy of Japan in Bangladesh</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plot No. 5 &amp; 7, Dutabash Road, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to maximize your chances of getting your visa, it is advisable that you fill in the application form carefully with no errors and submit sufficient proof to clearly show your intentions of studying and living in Japan. If the information in the application package is found to be falsified or fraudulent at any step, or that you have a serious criminal record, there is a possibility that your application will be denied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/schoolynkmedia/2020/06/d34a46ad-content_bangladesh_flag_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Getting Your Visa&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can submit your visa application between 9:00 to 11:00 on every working day at the Embassy of Japan in Bangladesh. Gates close at 10:50 for all visa applicants. Your application package needs to include your documents specified above. When you submit your application, you will receive an application receipt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It typically takes a minimum of five working days to receive the visa after the interview at the Embassy. However, it is also important to remember that it might take longer if the Embassy finds issues with your application, such as missing documents or unclear information, in which you have to add or revise your documents to increase your credibility. In the event that there is a missing required document, or six months have not passed since your last visa refusal, the Embassy may deny your visa application. Furthermore, it is highly recommended to apply for a visa well in advance of your travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your application process goes smoothly, you will be able to receive your passport and have all original documents returned between 14:30 to 15:30 on the instructed day. When you come to the embassy to pick up your passport and visa, you are required to submit the application receipt. In case you send another individual to pick your passport on behalf of you, you need to prepare the application receipt and authorization with your valid signature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Arriving in Japan</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have a student visa in Japan, you are able to arrive in Japan now. When you arrive at the airport in Japan, you will need to fill in and submit a landing card. If you have a student visa, you can also apply for a work permit (Permission to Engage in Activity Other than that Permitted by the Status of Residence Previously Granted) at the airport, which will allow you to work part-time for 28 hours a week. Bear in mind that you are not allowed to work in the adult entertainment industry and illegal industries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the passport control, you will also be given your Residence Card, which is an important ID card that you should always carry with you throughout your time in Japan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The process may seem tedious, but don&rsquo;t let it discourage you from going after your dream of studying abroad. If you have a clear purpose and can demonstrate that you have the means and the ability to study in Japan, you will be able to acquire the coveted student visa in Japan in no time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px\">for more information :&nbsp;https://schoolynk.com/media/articles/66abb923-12cf-4ee7-8b8e-9e5f7d847e75</span></p>\r\n', '2018-09-11', '2021-02-20', 1),

(156, 'Netherlands', 'NLD', 'nl.png', '<h3>Long Stay Visa (MVV) / Residence Permit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re a student from Bangladesh, you&#39;ll need the Long Stay Visa (MVV) / Residence Permit to study in Netherlands. This visa is made specifically for students like you who are ready to begin their study abroad adventure in Netherlands. Find out the best information about the process of getting the Long Stay Visa (MVV) / Residence Permit to decide if studying abroad in Netherlands is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How much time will it take to get my visa?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to allow extra time for your visa application. Immediately after you&#39;ve been accepted to and enrolled in the university of your choice, you can already start your application for the&nbsp;Dutch&nbsp;Long Stay Visa (MVV) / Residence Permit . You should apply at least 3-5 months before your university degree programme starts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you&#39;ve applied, you can expect that you&#39;ll wait about 1 to 90 days for the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Main steps to take for the Dutch student visa</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is what Bangladeshi students have to do to get a student visa that will allow them to study in Netherlands:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you are accepted to a university in the Netherlands, the university applies for visa and residence permit on your behalf. If the application is accepted you have to make an appointment with the embassy in Bangladesh to collect the MVV and have your biometrics taken. You will have to take a tuberculosis test after arriving in the Netherlands for your university studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bangladeshi students maybe have to provide biometrics during the visa application process. Your biometrics are, basically, extra identification (e.g. fingerprinting and pictures) that countries use for security purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will have to attend a visa interview during the application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Long Stay Visa (MVV) / Residence Permit from Netherlands is valid for up to 3 months. So that you can stay during your entire degree programme, you may need to renew your visa every year. If you want to stay in Netherlands after your degree is over, you will have to apply for a different visa, or a visa renewal through the immigration office.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How much will I have to pay for the student visa?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for the&nbsp;Dutch&nbsp;Long Stay Visa (MVV) / Residence Permit , you will also have to pay a fee of 317 EUR. Depending on your situation, Dutch authorities will allow you to pay this fee online, on location at a visa application centre in Bangladesh, or through a bank transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bangladeshi students won&#39;t need to get health insurance for the Dutch visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What documents will I need to get for my student visa?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you apply for your visa, one of the most important things you need to prove is that you can support yourself during your study programme. For Netherlands, they require you to prove that you have available 868 EUR/month either from an external source, or already in your bank account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bangladeshi students won&#39;t have to prove they speak English well enough to study in an international university in Netherlands. These language skills ensure that you can succeed in your classes and manage your way around Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bangladeshi students will need to take a medical test before arriving in Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bangladeshi students will need to set up a Restricted Bank Account. This type of bank account restricts the amount of money you can withdraw every month, and only allows you to access it when you arrive in Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at the Netherlands immigration website for more detailed visa information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">for more information :&nbsp;https://www.mastersportal.com/visa-info/101-1/students-from-bangladesh-to-netherlands.html</span></p>\r\n', '2018-09-11', '2021-02-22', 1),
(157, 'New Caledonia', 'NCL', 'nc.png', '<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h6>REQUIRED DOCUMENTS TO APPLY</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6>&nbsp;</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>New Caledonia is a French overseas territory located east of Australia and west of Vanuatu. It is a small tropical paradise where you can enjoy fine dining and excellent French wine. It may be a remote location, which is why plenty of people come to relax in New Caledonia. The place consists of one main island, Grand Terre, and a few other smaller islands surrounding it. Before thinking of leaving for New Caledonia, there are a few things you should probably know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First things first, you need to make sure that you have the required documentation to enter New Caledonia. The territory may be administered by the French, but the visa policy is a bit different. For example, France is a part of the Schengen Area Agreement, but New Caledonia is not. For this reason, a Schengen visa will not grant you entry in New Caledonia. However, there are plenty of visa waiver countries whose citizens can travel there with just a passport. You need to make sure that your passport is valid for at least another 3 months from your arrival in New Caledonia or from your departure from New Caledonia, depending on the nationality. If you are not visa exempt, you need to apply for a visa. To do that, you need to pay a visit to the nearest French embassy or consulate and submit an application there. To find out the requirements, we recommend that you give the embassy a call. The information you find online should be used as reference only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting to New Caledonia is easy enough. There are two major airports there, and you can use multiple airlines. The location is popular among cruise ships as well, which is why you can get there by boat too. However, that is not happening around cyclone season, which is November through March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The climate in New Caledonia is semi-tropical. What does that mean? It means that while winters are warm, and the water is somewhere at 22 degrees Celsius, but that may still seem a bit cold for a swim. But during the summer, the place is ideal for getting lazy on the beach. You can just lay there and sip a cold beverage while you are getting a fantastic tan. Apart from the excellent beaches, you can go hiking in the mountains. The trails are gorgeous, and when you reach the top, you have a beautiful view over the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are not sitting in the sun or hiking, you can go snorkeling. New Caledonia has a stunning barrier reef that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is sometimes called the New Caledonia Lagoon. The water is so blue and the reef is so distinctive that you can see it from above as if it were drawn on a piece of paper. Windsurfing is also a popular activity in New Caledonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above, the cuisine in New Caledonia is exquisite. The French food has always been somewhere in the top as far as kitchens are concerned, and New Caledonia does not disappoint. However, eating out too often may set your budget back. Such delicious food comes at a high price, so make sure that you prepare your wallet for the trip. While you would expect the wine to be really expensive, it is not so bad. You can find several good reds at decent prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since New Caledonia is a French overseas territory, the official language is French. We recommend that you learn some phrases before your trip because finding someone who speaks English can be challenging. The staff in restaurants and hotels can communicate in English, but outside the capital, very few people are able to understand you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as safety is concerned, you do not have reason to worry. However, you need to be very careful when you go snorkeling because poisonous urchins are a thing in New Caledonia, and many people are stung every year. Other creatures may pose a threat as well such sea kraits and even sharks. All of them do not pose a real danger as long as you do not disturb them, stay close to shore, and listen to your guide (if applicable).The bottom line is that New Caledonia is a slice of paradise. The weather is heavenly, there are a lot of fun things to do, and you can relax as much as you want. The islands have something for everyone</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px\">for more information :&nbsp;https://www.ivisa.com/new-caledonia-visa</span><br />\r\n</p>\r\n', '2018-09-11', '2021-02-22', 1),

This article will help you to better understand the requirements and application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Do You Need a Visa?</strong><br />\r\nIn order to study in Poland, you will need to legalize your stay in the territory of the Republic of Poland. If you are a citizen of a European Union (EU) country and you would like to stay in Poland for longer than three months, you will need to register your stay in the country. Visas are not required for holders of United Nations &ldquo;laissez-passer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you are a non-EU citizen, you will need to obtain a visa at a Polish consulate in your home country before your arrival in Poland. Once you have arrived in Poland, you will need to apply for a Temporary Stay Card 45 days before your visa expires in order to prolong your stay. Visa approval to access Poland gives right of stay in the territory of the Republic of Poland only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Education Requirements for Student Visa</strong><br />\r\nIn order to study in Poland, you must have completed a secondary level education and be in possession of a leaving certificate that confirms that you are eligible to apply for university. If you passed the International Baccalaureate or European Baccalaureate exams, you may freely apply for undergraduate studies at a Polish university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, if you only have an equivalent qualification from your home country, you will need to have it legally recognized at one of the Polish diplomatic outposts or another appropriate institution. This means certifying that your diploma is in accordance with the law of the country in which it was issued. Then you will have to verify it with the Polish law. This process of granting recognition of a degree from a foreign university is called nostrification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Additionally, if you wish to be accepted for postgraduate studies in Poland, you will need to present an undergraduate diploma from a Polish institution or an overseas equivalent. You must present nostrification of your foreign diploma to a Polish university by the end of the first term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Visa Requirements</strong><br />\r\nIn order to apply for a student visa in Poland, you will need to submit several documents. These documents include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">A filled-in and signed Poland Student Visa Application form</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Valid passport (must be valid for three months after planned departure from Poland)</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Official letter of acceptance to a college or university in Poland</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">A short CV</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Your school certificates and diplomas</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Evidence of proficiency in the language in which you wish to study</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Confirmation of having the funds for studying and living in Poland</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Health insurance</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">One passport-sized photo</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Visa Application Fee, payable by cash/postal order</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Proof of Accommodation in Poland, if required</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Transport documentation, such as a rail or air ticket</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Health Insurance Requirement</strong><br />\r\nInternational students who study in Poland will need to obtain a doctor&rsquo;s certificate confirming that they can freely undertake study in the field of their choice. You will also need to be insured for the duration of your stay in Poland.

Most students are issued with an F-1 visa, and the general outline/process flow for obtaining an F1 visa is as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now that you have an initial idea of the process flow, lets go into more detail on each stage:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Pay your SEVIS Fee and Receive your I-20:</strong><br />\r\nOnce you&rsquo;re accepted, you will be required to pay the SEVIS I-901 Fee in order to be enrolled in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Then, your school will provide you with a Form I-20. This form will be presented to the consular officer when you attend your F-1 visa interview. If your spouse and/or children plan to reside in the USA with you while you study, they will be required to have individual Form I-20s, but they will not need to be enrolled in the SEVIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Complete the Visa Application:</strong><br />\r\nApplying for the F-1 student visa may vary depending on the U.S. embassy or consulate you are dealing with. You will be required to pay a non-refundable visa application fee. There is an online visa application available, which allows you to complete and print the Form DS-160 to take to your F-1 visa interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Schedule and Prepare for your Interview:</strong><br />\r\nYou can schedule your F-1 visa interview with the U.S. embassy or consulate. Wait times for interview appointments vary by location, season, and visa category, so you should apply for your visa early. An F-1 student visa for the USA can be issued up to 120 days in advance of your course of study start date. You will only be able to enter the US with an F-1 visa 30 days before your start date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The following documents are required for your F-1 visa interview:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>A valid passport</li>\r\n	<li>The Nonimmigrant Visa Application, Form DS-160</li>\r\n	<li>The application fee payment receipt</li>\r\n	<li>A passport photo</li>\r\n	<li>A Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status (Form 1-20)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional documents may be requested to prove your eligibility for the F-1 student visa, including academic transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates. Test scores such as the TOEFL, SAT, GRE, or GMAT may also be requested, as well as proof of your intent to depart the U.S. after your program is complete and proof of your financial stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attend your F-1 Visa Interview:</strong><br />\r\nYour F-1 visa interview will determine whether you are qualified to receive an F-1 student visa for the USA. Assuming that you have prepared the appropriate documents and meet all of the F-1 visa requirements, your visa will be approved at the discretion of the consular officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be required to pay a visa issuance fee. Digital fingerprint scans will be taken for records. Your passport will be taken so that you can get your visa and you will be informed when you can get it back, either by pick-up or in the mail.</p>\r\n', '2018-09-11', '2018-10-15', 1),

Get Visa on Arrival (Recommended)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to get a visa for visitors from Bangladesh (including Bangladeshi citizens and passport holders) who are traveling to Vietnam by air is to get Visa on Arrival (VOA) as it requires no travel or contact with the embassy for application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With VOA, you will get a visa approval letter via email before departure for Vietnam, and finally, get visa stamped upon arrival at Vietnam airport.
